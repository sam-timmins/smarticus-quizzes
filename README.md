"I AM SMARTICUS!"

Smarticus is an online quiz that allows the user to select form several catagories and prove that they are indeed 'Smarticus' or just a big thumbs down.

# UX

## User Goals

## Design Choices

### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to aid me in seclecting a suitable font. In order to keep the font for this game to a clean and simple look, I have chosen [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif?query=noto&preview.text=Smarticus&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles). This is the only one that I will use as I don't feel there is enough content involved to warrent complicating the look with different fonts for headers and text.

### Icons

I will use some icons to enhance the user experience for the choice of catagories, they will not be stand alone but there to accompany the text and break up te look of all text. The icons will be sourced from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). 

### Colours
In order to create the colour scheme for the quiz, I used [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/). I went the the generate new website colours until I found a colour that I likes, locked it in and kept going to get my basic scheme. I decided that as this was not a complex project where lots of different colours were needed, I would only use three. The generated colour scheme can be seen [here](wireframes/colour-pallet-original.jpg). 

When I checked the contrast in [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM"). Where the two colours were gray and white, I had an instant pass on the contrast checker, the results are [here](wireframes/contrast-checker-black-on-white.jpg). However, I had some fails on the tests where the background was red and the foreground was white, the result can be seen [here](wireframes/contrast-checker-fail-white-on-red.jpg). After a small adjustment the results passed and are [here](wireframes/contrast-checker-white-on-red.jpg), I created my final pallet.

\
&nbsp;
The colours use are explained from left to right:
* #9F2323 (red) This will be the base colour that will be on the header, also for any forms or information, such as the username input and feedback sections. 
* #F5F6F4 (white) This will be used as a background colour on the catagories grid, but primerilary as a font colour.
* #3A3232 (grey) This will be used mostly as a background colour for the questions card but also as a font colour where the background is white.

\
&nbsp;

During the building of the quiz, I realised that I required a colour to indicate if a correct answer was submitted. I will go into more detail of this in the [testing section](#testing). I again used [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/) and using my existing pallet to gain a complimentary green.
\
&nbsp;
* #51855f (green) This will show when the user has selected a correct answer.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first approach. Using the chrome developer tools to give me the iPhone 5/SE (320px), I will use this as the smallest screen size for styling. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes

In order to develop my wireframes, I have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). i created the mobile verision firstly and then the tablet and desktop versions followed. As it is a requirement that the site is on one static page, I have broken my wireframes down to reflect. 

The wireframes can be viewed below.

# Testing
## Layout
During the building of the quiz, I changed my design layout slightly from my initial wireframes design. I felt that the inclusion of a footer restricted the userâ€™s ability to quickly and cleanly play the game. Instead of all the option boxes being within the screen height, the user would have had to scroll in order to see option D. Along with the being able to include the __Smarticus__ name on every page so the user doesn't loose contact, I felt that it was a correct design choise to omit the footer.

In relation to responsive design, in my initial planning stages I thought that a final responsive screen size of min-width 992px would be sufficient, however the layout did not suit extra large screens of greater than or equal to 1200px so I added an extra media query to the design, this was a very little extra work for a big gain for larger screen users.
